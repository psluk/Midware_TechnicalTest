- **Applicant's Name:** Paúl Andrés Rodríguez García

## Instructions

In order to run this app, you need to clone the repository and have Node.js installed. This project was developed on Node.js v22.6.0 with npm (v10.9.0) as the package manager.

After cloning the repository, you have to switch to the `pokedex_test` directory (`cd pokedex_test`), install the necessary packages (`npm install`) and run the app (`npm run dev`). By default, this app runs on port `5173` (`https://localhost:5173/`), which you can open with any web browser.

## Comments

Out of both possible options for extra points, only the infinite scroll was implemented.

I am aware some CSS styles could have been implemented by using IDs rather than classes, but I feel more comfortable when using classes.

This project was developed with Vite + React + TypeScript.
